DearProfessor Attaur rehman,I hope this message finds yout well. As a student in your course Differential Equations I would like suggest some things. We are using an old text book which is not available in the library and there is literally no online help / support for the book we are using. If we run into a problem or something there is no way to find a solution for that problem. So please update the course contents for the upcoming juniors so they don't have to face problems we faced. It is a very important course for engineering students which we are need going to need for the AI and Machine Learning fields. 		Thankyou for your dedication to our education, and I appreciate yourconsideration of these suggestions.Sincerely,Muhammad Saad
