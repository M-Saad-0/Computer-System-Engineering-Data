Hadoop			1
is			1
an			1
open-source			1
framework			1
designed			1
for			1
distributed			1
storage			1
and			1
processing			1
of			1
large			1
datasets			1
across			1
clusters			1
of			1
computers			1
using			1
simple			1
programming			1
models.			1
It			1
was			1
originally			1
developed			1
by			1
Doug			1
Cutting			1
and			1
Mike			1
Cafarella,			1
inspired			1
by			1
Googleâ€™s			1
MapReduce			1
and			1

papers.			1
Hadoop			1
provides			1
a			1
scalable,			1
fault-tolerant			1
infrastructure			1
capable			1
of			1
handling			1
vast			1
amounts			1
of			1
data,			1
making			1
it			1
a			1
cornerstone			1
of			1
the			1
big			1
data			1
revolution.			1
Its			1
core			1
components			1
include			1
the			1
Hadoop			1
Distributed			1
File			1
System			1
(HDFS)			1
for			1
reliable,			1
high-throughput			1
data			1
storage			1
and			1
the			1
MapReduce			1
programming			1
model			1
for			1
parallel			1
data			1
processing.			1
In			1
addition,			1
the			1
Hadoop			1
ecosystem			1
includes			1
numerous			1
tools			1
like			1
Apache			1
Hive			1
for			1
querying			1
data			1
with			1
SQL-like			1
syntax,			1
Apache			1
Pig			1
for			1
scripting,			1
Apache			1
HBase			1
for			1
NoSQL			1
storage,			1
and			1
Apache			1
Spark			1
for			1
in-memory			1
processing.			1
Hadoop's			1
ability			1
to			1
work			1
on			1
commodity			1
hardware,			1
its			1
scalability			1
from			1
a			1
single			1
node			1
to			1
thousands			1
of			1
nodes,			1
and			1
its			1
cost-efficiency			1
make			1
it			1
an			1
essential			1
tool			1
for			1
organizations			1
dealing			1
with			1
data-intensive			1
applications.			1
It			1
is			1
widely			1
used			1
in			1
industries			1
such			1
as			1
finance,			1
healthcare,			1
retail,			1
and			1
social			1
media			1
for			1
tasks			1
like			1
data			1
mining,			1
machine			1
learning,			1
predictive			1
analytics,			1
and			1
log			1
analysis.			1
Over			1
the			1
years,			1
Hadoop			1
has			1
evolved			1
to			1
integrate			1
with			1
modern			1
technologies,			1
supporting			1
both			1
on-premise			1
and			1
cloud			1
deployments,			1
thereby			1
enabling			1
businesses			1
to			1
derive			1
actionable			1
insights			1
from			1
their			1
ever-growing			1
data			1
assets.			1
