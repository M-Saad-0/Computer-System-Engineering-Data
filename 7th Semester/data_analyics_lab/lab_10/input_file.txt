Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It was originally developed by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella, inspired by Googleâ€™s MapReduce and Google File System (GFS) papers. Hadoop provides a scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure capable of handling vast amounts of data, making it a cornerstone of the big data revolution. Its core components include the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for reliable, high-throughput data storage and the MapReduce programming model for parallel data processing. In addition, the Hadoop ecosystem includes numerous tools like Apache Hive for querying data with SQL-like syntax, Apache Pig for scripting, Apache HBase for NoSQL storage, and Apache Spark for in-memory processing. Hadoop's ability to work on commodity hardware, its scalability from a single node to thousands of nodes, and its cost-efficiency make it an essential tool for organizations dealing with data-intensive applications. It is widely used in industries such as finance, healthcare, retail, and social media for tasks like data mining, machine learning, predictive analytics, and log analysis. Over the years, Hadoop has evolved to integrate with modern technologies, supporting both on-premise and cloud deployments, thereby enabling businesses to derive actionable insights from their ever-growing data assets.
